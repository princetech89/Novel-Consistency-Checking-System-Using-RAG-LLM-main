                      'The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a '
                      'man wandering about naked and famished. The police of '
                      'Marseilles will be on the alert by land, whilst the '
                      'governor pursues me by sea. I am cold, I am hungry. I '
                      'have lost even the knife that saved me. Oh, my God, I '

                      'for me what I am unable to do for myself.” As Dantès '
                      '(his eyes turned in the direction of the Château d’If) '
                      'uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of '
                      'the Island of Pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail '
                      'skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey; and '
                      'with his sailor’s eye he knew it to be a Genoese '
                      'tartan. She was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and '
                      'was standing out to sea rapidly, her sharp prow '
                      'cleaving through the waves. “Oh,” cried Edmond, “to '
                      'think that in half an hour I could join her, did I not '
                      'fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to '
                      'Marseilles! What can I do? What story can I invent? '
                      'under pretext of trading along the coast, these men, '
                      'who are in reality smugglers, will prefer selling me to '
                      'doing a good action. I must wait. But I cannot—I am '
                      'starving. In a few hours my strength will be utterly '
                      'exhausted; besides, perhaps I have not been missed at '
                      'the fortress. I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked '
                      'last night. My story will be accepted, for there is no '
                      'one left to contradict me.” As he spoke, Dantès looked '
                      'toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had been '
                      'wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors '
                      'hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had '
                      'formed part of the vessel’s keel, floated at the foot '
                      'of the crag. In an instant Dantès’ plan was formed. He '
                      'swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of '
                      'the timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the '
                      'course the vessel was taking. “I am saved!” murmured '
                      'he. And this conviction restored his strength. He soon '
                      'saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was '
                      'tacking between the Château d’If and the tower of '
                      'Planier. For an instant he feared lest, instead of '
                      'keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea; but he '
                      'soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound '
                      'for Italy, between the islands of Jaros and '
                      'Calaseraigne. However, the vessel and the swimmer '
                      'insensibly neared one another, and in one of its tacks '
                      'the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him. '
                      'He rose on the waves, making signs of distress; but no '
                      'one on board saw him, and the vessel stood on another '
                      'tack. Dantès would have shouted, but he knew that the '
                      'wind would drown his voice. It was then he rejoiced at '
                      'his precaution in taking the timber, for without it he '
                      'would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the '
                      'vessel—certainly to return to shore, should he be '
                      'unsuccessful in attracting attention. Dantès, though '
                      'almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, '
                      'had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood '
                      'towards him. Then he advanced; but before they could '
                      'meet, the vessel again changed her course. By a violent '
                      'effort he rose half out of the water, waving his cap, '
                      'and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors. This '
                      'time he was both seen and heard, and the tartan '
                      'instantly steered towards him. At the same time, he saw '
                      'they were about to lower the boat. An instant after, '
                      'the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards '
                      'him. Dantès let go of the timber, which he now thought '
                      'to be useless, and swam vigorously to meet them. But he '
                      'had reckoned too much upon his strength, and then he '
                      'realized how serviceable the timber had been to him. '
                      'His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, '
                      'and he was almost breathless. He shouted again. The two '
                      'sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of them cried '
                      'in Italian, “Courage!” The word reached his ear as a '
                      'wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount '
                      'passed over his head. He rose again to the surface, '
                      'struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning '
                      'man, uttered a third cry, and felt himself sinking, as '
                      'if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet. '
                      'The water passed over his head, and the sky turned '
                      'gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the '
                      'surface. He felt himself seized by the hair, then he '
                      'saw and heard nothing. He had fainted. When he opened '
                      'his eyes Dantès found himself on the deck of the '
                      'tartan. His first care was to see what course they were '
                      'taking. They were rapidly leaving the Château d’If '
                      'behind. Dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of '
                      'joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh. As we have '
                      'said, he was lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing '
                      'his limbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he '
                      'recognized as the one who had cried out “Courage!” held '
                      'a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while the third, an '
                      'old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on '
                      'with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune '
                      'that they have escaped yesterday, and which may '
                      'overtake them tomorrow. A few drops of the rum restored '
                      'suspended animation, while the friction of his limbs '
                      'restored their elasticity. “Who are you?” said the '
                      'pilot in bad French. “I am,” replied Dantès, in bad '
                      'Italian, “a Maltese sailor. We were coming from '
                      'Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night '
                      'overtook us at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on '
                      'these rocks.” “Where do you come from?” “From these '
                      'rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our '
                      'captain and the rest of'},

                      'are you taking me?” asked he. “You will soon know.” '
                      '“But still——” “We are forbidden to give you any '
                      'explanation.” Dantès, trained in discipline, knew that '
                      'nothing would be more absurd than to question '
                      'subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he '
                      'remained silent. The most vague and wild thoughts '
                      'passed through his mind. The boat they were in could '
                      'not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor '
                      'outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were '
                      'going to leave him on some distant point. He was not '
                      'bound, nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him; '
                      'this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy, '
                      'who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he '
                      'did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had '
                      'nothing to apprehend? Had not Villefort in his presence '
                      'destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof against him? '
                      'He waited silently, striving to pierce through the '
                      'darkness. They had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the '
                      'lighthouse stood, on the right, and were now opposite '
                      'the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the prisoner that '
                      'he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for '
                      'it was there Mercédès dwelt. How was it that a '
                      'presentiment did not warn Mercédès that her lover was '
                      'within three hundred yards of her? One light alone was '
                      'visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’ '
                      'chamber. Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole '
                      'settlement. A loud cry could be heard by her. But pride '
                      'restrained him and he did not utter it. What would his '
                      'guards think if they heard him shout like a madman? He '
                      'remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the '
                      'boat went on, but the prisoner thought only of '
                      'Mercédès. An intervening elevation of land hid the '
                      'light. Dantès turned and perceived that they had got '
                      'out to sea. While he had been absorbed in thought, they '
                      'had shipped their oars and hoisted sail; the boat was '
                      'now moving with the wind. In spite of his repugnance to '
                      'address the guards, Dantès turned to the nearest '
                      'gendarme, and taking his hand, “Comrade,” said he, “I '
                      'adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to tell me '
                      'where we are going. I am Captain Dantès, a loyal '
                      'Frenchman, thought accused of treason; tell me where '
                      'you are conducting me, and I promise you on my honor I '
                      'will submit to my fate.” The gendarme looked '
                      'irresolutely at his companion, who returned for answer '
                      'a sign that said, “I see no great harm in telling him '
                      'now,” and the gendarme replied: “You are a native of '
                      'Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know where '
                      'you are going?” “On my honor, I have no idea.” “Have '
                      'you no idea whatever?” “None at all.” “That is '
                      'impossible.” “I swear to you it is true. Tell me, I '
                      'entreat.” “But my orders.” “Your orders do not forbid '
                      'your telling me what I must know in ten minutes, in '
                      'half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even '
                      'if I intended.” “Unless you are blind, or have never '
                      'been outside the harbor, you must know.” “I do not.” '
                      '“Look round you then.” Dantès rose and looked forward, '
                      'when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the '
                      'black and frowning rock on which stands the Château '
                      'd’If. This gloomy fortress, which has for more than '
                      'three hundred years furnished food for so many wild '
                      'legends, seemed to Dantès like a scaffold to a '
                      'malefactor. “The Château d’If?” cried he, “what are we '
                      'going there for?” The gendarme smiled. “I am not going '
                      'there to be imprisoned,” said Dantès; “it is only used '
                      'for political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are '
                      'there any magistrates or judges at the Château d’If?” '
                      '“There are only,” said the gendarme, “a governor, a '
                      'garrison, turnkeys, and good thick walls. Come, come, '
                      'do not look so astonished, or you will make me think '
                      'you are laughing at me in return for my good nature.” '
                      'Dantès pressed the gendarme’s hand as though he would '
                      'crush it. “You think, then,” said he, “that I am taken '
                      'to the Château d’If to be imprisoned there?” “It is '
                      'probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.” '
                      '“Without any inquiry, without any formality?” “All the '
                      'formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is '
                      'already made.” “And so, in spite of M. de Villefort’s '
                      'promises?” “I do not know what M. de Villefort promised '
                      'you,” said the gendarme, “but I know we are taking you '
                      'to the Château d’If. But what are you doing? Help, '
                      'comrades, help!” By a rapid movement, which the '
                      'gendarme’s practiced eye had perceived, Dantès sprang '
                      'forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but four '
                      'vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom '
                      'of the boat. He fell back cursing with rage. “Good!” '
                      'said the gendarme, placing his knee on his chest; “this '
                      'is the way you keep your word as a sailor! Believe '
                      'soft-spoken gentlemen again! Hark ye, my friend, I have '
                      'disobeyed my first order, but I will not disobey the '
                      'second; and if you move, I will blow your brains out.” '
                      'And he levelled his carbine at Dantès, who felt the '
                      'muzzle against his temple. For a moment the idea of '
                      'struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending the '
                      'unexpected evil that had overtaken him. But he '
                      'bethought him of M. de Villefort’s promise; and, '
                      'besides, death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme '
                      'seemed too terrible. He remained motionless, but '

                      'this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent '
                      'shock. One of the sailors leaped on shore, a cord '
                      'creaked as it ran through a pulley, and Dantès guessed '
                      'they were at the end of the voyage, and that they were '

                      'where the sentry kept watch; once there, a large '
                      'excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones '
                      'with which the gallery was paved be so completely '
                      'loosened that at the desired moment it would give way '
                      'beneath the feet of the soldier, who, stunned by his '
                      'fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dantès '
                      'before he had power to offer any resistance. The '
                      'prisoners were then to make their way through one of '
                      'the gallery windows, and to let themselves down from '
                      'the outer walls by means of the abbé’s ladder of cords. '
                      'Dantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands '
                      'with delight at the idea of a plan so simple, yet '
                      'apparently so certain to succeed. That very day the '
                      'miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity '
                      'proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their '
                      'hopes of ultimate success. Nothing interrupted the '
                      'progress of the work except the necessity that each was '
                      'under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the '
                      'turnkey’s visits. They had learned to distinguish the '
                      'almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he '
                      'descended towards their dungeons, and happily, never '
                      'failed of being prepared for his coming. The fresh '
                      'earth excavated during their present work, and which '
                      'would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was '
                      'thrown, by degrees and with the utmost precaution, out '
                      'of the window in either Faria’s or Dantès’ cell, the '
                      'rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night '
                      'wind carried it far away without permitting the '
                      'smallest trace to remain. More than a year had been '
                      'consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for which '
                      'had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria '
                      'still continuing to instruct Dantès by conversing with '
                      'him, sometimes in one language, sometimes in another; '
                      'at others, relating to him the history of nations and '
                      'great men who from time to time have risen to fame and '
                      'trodden the path of glory. The abbé was a man of the '
                      'world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first society of '
                      'the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which '
                      'Dantès, thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him '
                      'by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward '
                      'polish and politeness he had before been wanting in, '
                      'and which is seldom possessed except by those who have '
                      'been placed in constant intercourse with persons of '
                      'high birth and breeding. At the end of fifteen months '
                      'the level was finished, and the excavation completed '
                      'beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could '
                      'distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as '
                      'he paced to and fro over their heads. Compelled, as '
                      'they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor '
                      'their flight, they were obliged to defer their final '
                      'attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive; '
                      'their greatest dread now was lest the stone through '
                      'which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way '
                      'before its right time, and this they had in some '
                      'measure provided against by propping it up with a small '
                      'beam which they had discovered in the walls through '
                      'which they had worked their way. Dantès was occupied in '
                      'arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who '
                      'had remained in Edmond’s cell for the purpose of '
                      'cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him '
                      'in a tone indicative of great suffering. Dantès '
                      'hastened to his dungeon, where he found him standing in '
                      'the middle of the room, pale as death, his forehead '
                      'streaming with perspiration, and his hands clenched '
                      'tightly together. “Gracious heavens!” exclaimed Dantès, '
                      '“what is the matter? what has happened?” “Quick! '
                      'quick!” returned the abbé, “listen to what I have to '
                      'say.” Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid '
                      'countenance of Faria, whose eyes, already dull and '
                      'sunken, were surrounded by purple circles, while his '
                      'lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair '
                      'seemed to stand on end. “Tell me, I beseech you, what '
                      'ails you?” cried Dantès, letting his chisel fall to the '
                      'floor. “Alas,” faltered out the abbé, “all is over with '
                      'me. I am seized with a terrible, perhaps mortal '
                      'illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast '
                      'approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous '
                      'to my imprisonment. This malady admits but of one '
                      'remedy; I will tell you what that is. Go into my cell '
                      'as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet that '
                      'support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out '
                      'for the purpose of containing a small phial you will '
                      'see there half-filled with a red-looking fluid. Bring '
                      'it to me—or rather—no, no!—I may be found here, '
                      'therefore help me back to my room while I have the '
                      'strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may '
                      'happen, or how long the attack may last?” In spite of '
                      'the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly '
                      'frustrated his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence '
                      'of mind, but descended into the passage, dragging his '
                      'unfortunate companion with him; then, half-carrying, '
                      'half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbé’s '
                      'chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his '
                      'bed. “Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though '
                      'his veins were filled with ice. “I am about to be '
                      'seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it comes to its '

                      'like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes of '
                      'artillery. This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, '
                      'than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs '
                      'officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the '
                      'first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his '
                      'recruit. Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what '
                      'the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; '
                      'and however the old sailor and his crew tried to “pump” '
                      'him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave '
                      'accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he '
                      'knew as well as Marseilles, and held stoutly to his '
                      'first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was '
                      'duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his '
                      'nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, '
                      'pleaded. Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was '
                      'one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what '
                      'they should know, and believe nothing but what they '
                      'should believe. In this state of mutual understanding, '
                      'they reached Leghorn. Here Edmond was to undergo '
                      'another trial; he was to find out whether he could '
                      'recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for '
                      'fourteen years. He had preserved a tolerably good '
                      'remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to '
                      'find out what the man had become. His comrades believed '
                      'that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times '
                      'touched at Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. '
                      'Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his beard and '
                      'hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man '
                      'with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which '
                      'gave his head the appearance of one of Titian’s '
                      'portraits. At this period it was not the fashion to '
                      'wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber '
                      'would only be surprised if a man gifted with such '
                      'advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive '
                      'himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and '
                      'went to work. When the operation was concluded, and '
                      'Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and '
                      'his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a '
                      'looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, '
                      'three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years’ '
                      'imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his '
                      'appearance. Dantès had entered the Château d’If with '
                      'the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, '
                      'with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and '
                      'who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. '
                      'This was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, '
                      'his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines '
                      'which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched '
                      'beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were '
                      'full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally '
                      'sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his '
                      'complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that '
                      'pale color which produces, when the features are '
                      'encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of '
                      'the man of the north; the profound learning he had '
                      'acquired had besides diffused over his features a '
                      'refined intellectual expression; and he had also '
                      'acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that '
                      'vigor which a frame possesses which has so long '
                      'concentrated all its force within itself. 0283m To the '
                      'elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the '
                      'solidity of a rounded and muscular figure. As to his '
                      'voice, prayers, sobs, and imprecations had changed it '
                      'so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating '
                      'sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse. '
                      'Moreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, '
                      'his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing '
                      'objects in the night, common to the hyena and the wolf. '
                      'Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible '
                      'that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend '
                      'left—could recognize him; he could not recognize '
                      'himself. The master of _La Jeune Amélie_, who was very '
                      'desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of '
                      'Edmond’s value, had offered to advance him funds out of '
                      'his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next '
                      'care on leaving the barber’s who had achieved his first '
                      'metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete '
                      'sailor’s suit—a garb, as we all know, very simple, and '
                      'consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt, and a '
                      'cap. It was in this costume, and bringing back to '
                      'Jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him, that '
                      'Edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger, who '
                      'had made him tell his story over and over again before '
                      'he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim '
                      'sailor the man with thick and matted beard, hair '
                      'tangled with seaweed, and body soaking in seabrine, '
                      'whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned. '
                      'Attracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed '
                      'his offers of an engagement to Dantès; but Dantès, who '
                      'had his own projects, would not agree for a longer time '
                      'than three months. _La Jeune Amélie_ had a very active '
                      'crew, very obedient to their captain, who lost as '
                      'little time as possible. He had scarcely been a week at '
                      'Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with '
                      'printed muslins, contraband cottons, English powder, '
                      'and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put '
                      'its mark. The master was to get all this out of Leghorn '
                      'free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, '
                      'where certain speculators undertook to forward the '

                      'restored their elasticity. “Who are you?” said the '
                      'pilot in bad French. “I am,” replied Dantès, in bad '
                      'Italian, “a Maltese sailor. We were coming from '
                      'Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night '
                      'overtook us at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on '
                      'these rocks.” “Where do you come from?” “From these '
                      'rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our '
                      'captain and the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw '
                      'your vessel, and fearful of being left to perish on the '
                      'desolate island, I swam off on a piece of wreckage to '
                      'try and intercept your course. You have saved my life, '
                      'and I thank you,” continued Dantès. “I was lost when '
                      'one of your sailors caught hold of my hair.” “It was '
                      'I,” said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; “and '
                      'it was time, for you were sinking.” “Yes,” returned '
                      'Dantès, holding out his hand, “I thank you again.” “I '
                      'almost hesitated, though,” replied the sailor; “you '
                      'looked more like a brigand than an honest man, with '
                      'your beard six inches, and your hair a foot long.” '
                      'Dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been '
                      'cut all the time he was at the Château d’If. “Yes,” '
                      'said he, “I made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not '
                      'to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved '
                      'in a moment of danger; but today the vow expires.” “Now '
                      'what are we to do with you?” said the captain. “Alas, '
                      'anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely '
                      'escaped; but I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first '
                      'port you make; I shall be sure to find employment.” “Do '
                      'you know the Mediterranean?” “I have sailed over it '
                      'since my childhood.” “You know the best harbors?” '
                      '“There are few ports that I could not enter or leave '
                      'with a bandage over my eyes.” “I say, captain,” said '
                      'the sailor who had cried “Courage!” to Dantès, “if what '
                      'he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?” “If '
                      'he says true,” said the captain doubtingly. “But in his '
                      'present condition he will promise anything, and take '
                      'his chance of keeping it afterwards.” “I will do more '
                      'than I promise,” said Dantès. “We shall see,” returned '
                      'the other, smiling. “Where are you going?” asked '
                      'Dantès. “To Leghorn.” “Then why, instead of tacking so '
                      'frequently, do you not sail nearer the wind?” “Because '
                      'we should run straight on to the Island of Rion.” “You '
                      'shall pass it by twenty fathoms.” “Take the helm, and '
                      'let us see what you know.” The young man took the helm, '
                      'felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly '
                      'and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she '
                      'yet was tolerably obedient. “To the sheets,” said he. '
                      'The four seamen, who composed the crew, obeyed, while '
                      'the pilot looked on. “Haul taut.” They obeyed. “Belay.” '
                      'This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as '
                      'Dantès had predicted, twenty fathoms to windward. '
                      '“Bravo!” said the captain. “Bravo!” repeated the '
                      'sailors. And they all looked with astonishment at this '
                      'man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his '
                      'body a vigor they had not thought him capable of '
                      'showing. “You see,” said Dantès, quitting the helm, “I '
                      'shall be of some use to you, at least during the '
                      'voyage. If you do not want me at Leghorn, you can leave '
                      'me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I '
                      'get, for my food and the clothes you lend me.” “Ah,” '
                      'said the captain, “we can agree very well, if you are '
                      'reasonable.” “Give me what you give the others, and it '
                      'will be all right,” returned Dantès. “That’s not fair,” '
                      'said the seaman who had saved Dantès; “for you know '
                      'more than we do.” “What is that to you, Jacopo?” '
                      'returned the Captain. “Everyone is free to ask what he '
                      'pleases.” “That’s true,” replied Jacopo; “I only make a '
                      'remark.” “Well, you would do much better to find him a '
                      'jacket and a pair of trousers, if you have them.” “No,” '
                      'said Jacopo; “but I have a shirt and a pair of '
                      'trousers.” “That is all I want,” interrupted Dantès. '
                      'Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what '
                      'Edmond wanted. “Now, then, do you wish for anything '
                      'else?” said the patron. “A piece of bread and another '
                      'glass of the capital rum I tasted, for I have not eaten '
                      'or drunk for a long time.” He had not tasted food for '
                      'forty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo '
                      'offered him the gourd. “Larboard your helm,” cried the '
                      'captain to the steersman. Dantès glanced that way as he '
                      'lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in '
                      'mid-air. “Hollo! what’s the matter at the Château '
                      'd’If?” said the captain. A small white cloud, which had '
                      'attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned the summit of the '
                      'bastion of the Château d’If. At the same moment the '
                      'faint report of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at '
                      'one another. “What is this?” asked the captain. “A '
                      'prisoner has escaped from the Château d’If, and they '
                      'are firing the alarm'},

Abbé Faria taught Edmond Dantès many languages.,SUPPORT,0.97,"[{'id': '7e63c88c-1133-427b-9e89-3105fde88ce1',

                      'your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so '
                      'learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute '
                      'solitude to being tormented with the company of one as '
                      'ignorant and uninformed as myself. If you will only '
                      'agree to my request, I promise you never to mention '
                      'another word about escaping.” The abbé smiled. “Alas, '
                      'my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined within '
                      'very narrow limits; and when I have taught you '
                      'mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four '
                      'modern languages with which I am acquainted, you will '
                      'know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely '
                      'require two years for me to communicate to you the '
                      'stock of learning I possess.” “Two years!” exclaimed '
                      'Dantès; “do you really believe I can acquire all these '
                      'things in so short a time?” “Not their application, '
                      'certainly, but their principles you may; to learn is '
                      'not to know; there are the learners and the learned. '
                      'Memory makes the one, philosophy the other.” “But '
                      'cannot one learn philosophy?” “Philosophy cannot be '
                      'taught; it is the application of the sciences to truth; '
                      'it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went '
                      'up into heaven.” “Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall '
                      'you teach me first? I am in a hurry to begin. I want to '
                      'learn.” “Everything,” said the abbé. And that very '
                      'evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education, to '
                      'be entered upon the following day. Dantès possessed a '
                      'prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing '
                      'quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical '
                      'turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of '
                      'calculation, while his naturally poetical feelings '
                      'threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of '
                      'arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of '
                      'geometry. He already knew Italian, and had also picked '
                      'up a little of the Romaic dialect during voyages to the '
                      'East; and by the aid of these two languages he easily '
                      'comprehended the construction of all the others, so '
                      'that at the end of six months he began to speak '
                      'Spanish, English, and German. In strict accordance with '
                      'the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no more of '
                      'escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him '
                      'left no room for such thoughts; perhaps the '
                      'recollection that he had pledged his word (on which his '
                      'sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring in any '
                      'way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, '
                      'passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course. '
                      'At the end of a year Dantès was a new man. Dantès '
                      'observed, however, that Faria, in spite of the relief '
                      'his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought '
                      'seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind. '
                      'Sometimes he would fall into long reveries, sigh '
                      'heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise, and, '
                      'with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of '
                      'his dungeon. One day he stopped all at once, and '
                      'exclaimed: “Ah, if there were no sentinel!” “There '
                      'shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said '
                      'Dantès, who had followed the working of his thoughts as '
                      'accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal '
                      'so clear as to display its minutest operations. “I have '
                      'already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe '
                      'the idea of shedding blood.” “And yet the murder, if '
                      'you choose to call it so, would be simply a measure of '
                      'self-preservation.” “No matter! I could never agree to '
                      'it.” “Still, you have thought of it?” “Incessantly, '
                      'alas!” cried the abbé. “And you have discovered a means '
                      'of regaining our freedom, have you not?” asked Dantès '
                      'eagerly. “I have; if it were only possible to place a '
                      'deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us.” “He '
                      'shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, '
                      'with an air of determination that made his companion '
                      'shudder. “No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!” Dantès '
                      'endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his '
                      'head in token of disapproval, and refused to make any '
                      'further response. Three months passed away. “Are you '
                      'strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young '
                      'man, in reply, took up the chisel, bent it into the '
                      'form of a horseshoe, and then as readily straightened '
                      'it. “And will you engage not to do any harm to the '
                      'sentry, except as a last resort?” “I promise on my '
                      'honor.” “Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our '
                      'design into execution.” “And how long shall we be in '
                      'accomplishing the necessary work?” “At least a year.” '
                      '“And shall we begin at once?” “At once.” “We have lost '
                      'a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès. “Do you consider '
                      'the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the '
                      'abbé. “Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply. '
                      '“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after '
                      'all, and you are about the best specimen of the genus I '
                      'have ever known. Come, let me show you my plan.” The '
                      'abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for '
                      'their escape. It consisted of a plan of his own cell '
                      'and that of Dantès, with the passage which united them. '
                      'In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do '
                      'in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners '
                      'immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept '
                      'watch; once there, a large excavation would be made, '
                      'and one of the flag-stones with which the gallery was '
                      'paved be so completely loosened that at the desired '
                      'moment it would give way beneath the feet of the '
                      'soldier, who, stunned by his fall, would be immediately '
                      'bound and gagged by Dantès before he had power to offer '
                      'any resistance. The prisoners were then to make their '
                      'way through one of the gallery windows, and to let '
                      'themselves down from the outer walls by means of the '
                      'abbé’s ladder of cords. Dantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, '

                      'this Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to '
                      'keep concealed? This Noirtier was his father!” Had a '
                      'thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès, or hell '
                      'opened its yawning gulf before him, he could not have '
                      'been more completely transfixed with horror than he was '
                      'at the sound of these unexpected words. Starting up, he '
                      'clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent '
                      'his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, “His '
                      'father! his father!” “Yes, his father,” replied the '
                      'abbé; “his right name was Noirtier de Villefort.” At '
                      'this instant a bright light shot through the mind of '
                      'Dantès, and cleared up all that had been dark and '
                      'obscure before. The change that had come over Villefort '
                      'during the examination, the destruction of the letter, '
                      'the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of '
                      'the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than '
                      'to pronounce punishment,—all returned with a stunning '
                      'force to his memory. He cried out, and staggered '
                      'against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried to '
                      'the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to his own, '
                      'and said, “I must be alone, to think over all this.” '
                      'When he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his '
                      'bed, where the turnkey found him in the evening visit, '
                      'sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features, dumb '
                      'and motionless as a statue. During these hours of '
                      'profound meditation, which to him had seemed only '
                      'minutes, he had formed a fearful resolution, and bound '
                      'himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath. Dantès was '
                      'at length roused from his reverie by the voice of '
                      'Faria, who, having also been visited by his jailer, had '
                      'come to invite his fellow-sufferer to share his supper. '
                      'The reputation of being out of his mind, though '
                      'harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the '
                      'abbé unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of '
                      'a finer, whiter quality than the usual prison fare, and '
                      'even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of wine. '
                      'Now this was a Sunday, and the abbé had come to ask his '
                      'young companion to share the luxuries with him. Dantès '
                      'followed him; his features were no longer contracted, '
                      'and now wore their usual expression, but there was that '
                      'in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come '
                      'to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria bent on him his '
                      'penetrating eye. “I regret now,” said he, “having '
                      'helped you in your late inquiries, or having given you '
                      'the information I did.” “Why so?” inquired Dantès. '
                      '“Because it has instilled a new passion in your '
                      'heart—that of vengeance.” Dantès smiled. “Let us talk '
                      'of something else,” said he. Again the abbé looked at '
                      'him, then mournfully shook his head; but in accordance '
                      'with Dantès’ request, he began to speak of other '
                      'matters. The elder prisoner was one of those persons '
                      'whose conversation, like that of all who have '
                      'experienced many trials, contained many useful and '
                      'important hints as well as sound information; but it '
                      'was never egotistical, for the unfortunate man never '
                      'alluded to his own sorrows. Dantès listened with '
                      'admiring attention to all he said; some of his remarks '
                      'corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to '
                      'the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him '
                      'to acquire. A part of the good abbé’s words, however, '
                      'were wholly incomprehensible to him; but, like the '
                      'aurora which guides the navigator in northern '
                      'latitudes, opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of '
                      'the listener, and gave fantastic glimpses of new '
                      'horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight '
                      'an intellectual mind would have in following one so '
                      'richly gifted as Faria along the heights of truth, '
                      'where he was so much at home. “You must teach me a '
                      'small part of what you know,” said Dantès, “if only to '
                      'prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe '
                      'that so learned a person as yourself would prefer '
                      'absolute solitude to being tormented with the company '
                      'of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself. If you '
                      'will only agree to my request, I promise you never to '
                      'mention another word about escaping.” The abbé smiled. '
                      '“Alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined '
                      'within very narrow limits; and when I have taught you '
                      'mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four '
                      'modern languages with which I am acquainted, you will '
                      'know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely '
                      'require two years for me to communicate to you the '
                      'stock of learning I possess.” “Two years!” exclaimed '
                      'Dantès; “do you really believe I can acquire all these '
                      'things in so short a time?” “Not their application, '
                      'certainly, but their principles you may; to learn is '
                      'not to know; there are the learners and the learned. '
                      'Memory makes the one, philosophy the other.” “But '
                      'cannot one learn philosophy?” “Philosophy cannot be '
                      'taught; it is the application of the sciences to truth; '
                      'it is like the golden cloud in'},

                      'abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are about the '
                      'best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let '
                      'me show you my plan.” The abbé then showed Dantès the '
                      'sketch he had made for their escape. It consisted of a '
                      'plan of his own cell and that of Dantès, with the '
                      'passage which united them. In this passage he proposed '
                      'to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would '
                      'bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery '
                      'where the sentry kept watch; once there, a large '
                      'excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones '
                      'with which the gallery was paved be so completely '
                      'loosened that at the desired moment it would give way '
                      'beneath the feet of the soldier, who, stunned by his '
                      'fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dantès '
                      'before he had power to offer any resistance. The '
                      'prisoners were then to make their way through one of '
                      'the gallery windows, and to let themselves down from '
                      'the outer walls by means of the abbé’s ladder of cords. '
                      'Dantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands '
                      'with delight at the idea of a plan so simple, yet '
                      'apparently so certain to succeed. That very day the '
                      'miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity '
                      'proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their '
                      'hopes of ultimate success. Nothing interrupted the '
                      'progress of the work except the necessity that each was '
                      'under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the '
                      'turnkey’s visits. They had learned to distinguish the '
                      'almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he '
                      'descended towards their dungeons, and happily, never '
                      'failed of being prepared for his coming. The fresh '
                      'earth excavated during their present work, and which '
                      'would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was '
                      'thrown, by degrees and with the utmost precaution, out '
                      'of the window in either Faria’s or Dantès’ cell, the '
                      'rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night '
                      'wind carried it far away without permitting the '
                      'smallest trace to remain. More than a year had been '
                      'consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for which '
                      'had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria '
                      'still continuing to instruct Dantès by conversing with '
                      'him, sometimes in one language, sometimes in another; '
                      'at others, relating to him the history of nations and '
                      'great men who from time to time have risen to fame and '
                      'trodden the path of glory. The abbé was a man of the '
                      'world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first society of '
                      'the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which '
                      'Dantès, thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him '
                      'by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward '
                      'polish and politeness he had before been wanting in, '
                      'and which is seldom possessed except by those who have '
                      'been placed in constant intercourse with persons of '
                      'high birth and breeding. At the end of fifteen months '
                      'the level was finished, and the excavation completed '
                      'beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could '
                      'distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as '
                      'he paced to and fro over their heads. Compelled, as '
                      'they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor '
                      'their flight, they were obliged to defer their final '
                      'attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive; '
                      'their greatest dread now was lest the stone through '
                      'which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way '
                      'before its right time, and this they had in some '
                      'measure provided against by propping it up with a small '
                      'beam which they had discovered in the walls through '
                      'which they had worked their way. Dantès was occupied in '
                      'arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who '
                      'had remained in Edmond’s cell for the purpose of '
                      'cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him '
                      'in a tone indicative of great suffering. Dantès '
                      'hastened to his dungeon, where he found him standing in '
                      'the middle of the room, pale as death, his forehead '
                      'streaming with perspiration, and his hands clenched '
                      'tightly together. “Gracious heavens!” exclaimed Dantès, '
                      '“what is the matter? what has happened?” “Quick! '
                      'quick!” returned the abbé, “listen to what I have to '
                      'say.” Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid '
                      'countenance of Faria, whose eyes, already dull and '
                      'sunken, were surrounded by purple circles, while his '
                      'lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair '
                      'seemed to stand on end. “Tell me, I beseech you, what '
                      'ails you?” cried Dantès, letting his chisel fall to the '
                      'floor. “Alas,” faltered out the abbé, “all is over with '
                      'me. I am seized with a terrible, perhaps mortal '
                      'illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast '
                      'approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous '
                      'to my imprisonment. This malady admits but of one '
                      'remedy; I will tell you what that is. Go into my cell '
                      'as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet that '
                      'support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out '
                      'for the purpose of containing a small phial you will '
                      'see there half-filled with a red-looking fluid. Bring '
                      'it to me—or rather—no, no!—I may be found here, '
                      'therefore help me back to my room while I have the '
                      'strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may '
                      'happen, or how long the attack may last?” In spite of '
                      'the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly '
                      'frustrated his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence '
                      'of mind, but descended into the passage, dragging his '
                      'unfortunate companion with him; then, half-carrying, '
                      'half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbé’s '
                      'chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his '
                      'bed. “Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though '
                      'his veins were filled with ice. “I am about to be '
                      'seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it comes to its '

                      'of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have '
                      'spoken, Dantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, '
                      'clinging to the bedstead. His features were writhing '
                      'with those horrible symptoms which he already knew, and '
                      'which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for '
                      'the first time. “Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a '
                      'resigned tone, “you understand, do you not, and I need '
                      'not attempt to explain to you?” Edmond uttered a cry of '
                      'agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed towards the '
                      'door, exclaiming, “Help, help!” Faria had just '
                      'sufficient strength to restrain him. “Silence,” he '
                      'said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, '
                      'my dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity '
                      'supportable or your flight possible. It would require '
                      'years to do again what I have done here, and the '
                      'results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers '
                      'knew we had communicated with each other. Besides, be '
                      'assured, my dear Edmond, the dungeon I am about to '
                      'leave will not long remain empty; some other '
                      'unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him '
                      'you will appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he '
                      'will be young, strong, and enduring, like yourself, and '
                      'will aid you in your escape, while I have been but a '
                      'hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead body '
                      'tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length '
                      'Providence has done something for you; he restores to '
                      'you more than he takes away, and it was time I should '
                      'die.” Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, '
                      '“Oh, my friend, my friend, speak not thus!” and then '
                      'resuming all his presence of mind, which had for a '
                      'moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, '
                      'which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, '
                      '“Oh, I have saved you once, and I will save you a '
                      'second time!” And raising the foot of the bed, he drew '
                      'out the phial, still a third filled with the red '
                      'liquor. “See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some '
                      'of the magic draught. Quick, quick! tell me what I must '
                      'do this time; are there any fresh instructions? Speak, '
                      'my friend; I listen.” “There is not a hope,” replied '
                      'Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter; God wills it '
                      'that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has '
                      'so profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in '
                      'his power to preserve that existence, which, however '
                      'painful it may be, is yet always so dear.” “Oh, yes, '
                      'yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will '
                      'save you yet.” “Well, then, try. The cold gains upon '
                      'me. I feel the blood flowing towards my brain. These '
                      'horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter and seem '
                      'to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; '
                      'in five minutes the malady will reach its height, and '
                      'in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of '
                      'me but a corpse.” “Oh!” exclaimed Dantès, his heart '
                      'wrung with anguish. “Do as you did before, only do not '
                      'wait so long, all the springs of life are now exhausted '
                      'in me, and death,” he continued, looking at his '
                      'paralyzed arm and leg, “has but half its work to do. '
                      'If, after having made me swallow twelve drops instead '
                      'of ten, you see that I do not recover, then pour the '
                      'rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for I can '
                      'no longer support myself.” Edmond took the old man in '
                      'his arms, and laid him on the bed. “And now, my dear '
                      'friend,” said Faria, “sole consolation of my wretched '
                      'existence,—you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but '
                      'still gave me, a priceless gift, and for which I am '
                      'most grateful,—at the moment of separating from you '
                      'forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the '
                      'prosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!” '
                      'The young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his '
                      'head against the old man’s bed. “Listen, now, to what I '
                      'say in this my dying moment. The treasure of the Spadas '
                      'exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted '
                      'by time or space. I see it in the depths of the inner '

                      'features by the aid of the imperfect light that '
                      'struggled through the grating. He was a man of small '
                      'stature, with hair blanched rather by suffering and '
                      'sorrow than by age. He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, '
                      'almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a '
                      'long (and still black) beard reaching down to his '
                      'breast. His thin face, deeply furrowed by care, and the '
                      'bold outline of his strongly marked features, betokened '
                      'a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties '
                      'than his physical strength. Large drops of perspiration '
                      'were now standing on his brow, while the garments that '
                      'hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess '
                      'at the pattern upon which they had originally been '
                      'fashioned. The stranger might have numbered sixty or '
                      'sixty-five years; but a certain briskness and '
                      'appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable '
                      'that he was aged more from captivity than the course of '
                      'time. He received the enthusiastic greeting of his '
                      'young acquaintance with evident pleasure, as though his '
                      'chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by '
                      'his contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him '
                      'with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, '
                      'although he must at that moment have been suffering '
                      'bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly '
                      'reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his '
                      'liberty. “Let us first see,” said he, “whether it is '
                      'possible to remove the traces of my entrance here—our '
                      'future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being '
                      'entirely ignorant of it.” Advancing to the opening, he '
                      'stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its '
                      'weight; then, fitting it into its place, he said: “You '
                      'removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you '
                      'had no tools to aid you.” “Why,” exclaimed Dantès, with '
                      'astonishment, “do you possess any?” “I made myself '
                      'some; and with the exception of a file, I have all that '
                      'are necessary,—a chisel, pincers, and lever.” 0201m '
                      '“Oh, how I should like to see these products of your '
                      'industry and patience.” “Well, in the first place, here '
                      'is my chisel.” So saying, he displayed a sharp strong '
                      'blade, with a handle made of beechwood. “And with what '
                      'did you contrive to make that?” inquired Dantès. “With '
                      'one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool '
                      'has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which I came '
                      'hither, a distance of about fifty feet.” “Fifty feet!” '
                      'responded Dantès, almost terrified. “Do not speak so '
                      'loud, young man—don’t speak so loud. It frequently '
                      'occurs in a state prison like this, that persons are '
                      'stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to '
                      'overhear the conversation of the prisoners.” “But they '
                      'believe I am shut up alone here.” “That makes no '
                      'difference.” “And you say that you dug your way a '
                      'distance of fifty feet to get here?” “I do; that is '
                      'about the distance that separates your chamber from '
                      'mine; only, unfortunately, I did not curve aright; for '
                      'want of the necessary geometrical instruments to '
                      'calculate my scale of proportion, instead of taking an '
                      'ellipsis of forty feet, I made it fifty. I expected, as '
                      'I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, '
                      'and throw myself into the sea; I have, however, kept '
                      'along the corridor on which your chamber opens, instead '
                      'of going beneath it. My labor is all in vain, for I '
                      'find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled '
                      'with soldiers.” “That’s true,” said Dantès; “but the '
                      'corridor you speak of only bounds _one_ side of my '
                      'cell; there are three others—do you know anything of '
                      'their situation?” “This one is built against the solid '
                      'rock, and it would take ten experienced miners, duly '
                      'furnished with the requisite tools, as many years to '
                      'perforate it. This adjoins the lower part of the '
                      'governor’s apartments, and were we to work our way '
                      'through, we should only get into some lock-up cellars, '
                      'where we must necessarily be recaptured. The fourth and '
                      'last side of your cell faces on—faces on—stop a minute, '
                      'now where does it face?” The wall of which he spoke was '
                      'the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light '
                      'was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which '
                      'gradually diminished in size as it approached the '
                      'outside, to an opening through which a child could not '
                      'have passed, was, for better security, furnished with '
                      'three iron bars, so as to quiet all apprehensions even '
                      'in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the '
                      'possibility of a prisoner’s escape. As the stranger '
                      'asked the question, he dragged the table beneath the '

                      'he whom you await is inconstant, or if he is not, the '
                      'sea is so to him.” “Fernand,” cried Mercédès, “I '
                      'believed you were good-hearted, and I was mistaken! '
                      'Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy '
                      'and the anger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do '
                      'await, and I do love him of whom you speak; and, if he '
                      'does not return, instead of accusing him of the '
                      'inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you that '
                      'he died loving me and me only.” The young girl made a '
                      'gesture of rage. “I understand you, Fernand; you would '
                      'be revenged on him because I do not love you; you would '
                      'cross your Catalan knife with his dirk. What end would '
                      'that answer? To lose you my friendship if he were '
                      'conquered, and see that friendship changed into hate if '
                      'you were victor. Believe me, to seek a quarrel with a '
                      'man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves '
                      'that man. No, Fernand, you will not thus give way to '
                      'evil thoughts. Unable to have me for your wife, you '
                      'will content yourself with having me for your friend '
                      'and sister; and besides,” she added, her eyes troubled '
                      'and moistened with tears, “wait, wait, Fernand; you '
                      'said just now that the sea was treacherous, and he has '
                      'been gone four months, and during these four months '
                      'there have been some terrible storms.” Fernand made no '
                      'reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which '
                      'flowed down the cheeks of Mercédès, although for each '
                      'of these tears he would have shed his heart’s blood; '
                      'but these tears flowed for another. He arose, paced a '
                      'while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly stopping '
                      'before Mercédès, with his eyes glowing and his hands '
                      'clenched,—“Say, Mercédès,” he said, “once for all, is '
                      'this your final determination?” “I love Edmond Dantès,” '
                      'the young girl calmly replied, “and none but Edmond '
                      'shall ever be my husband.” “And you will always love '
                      'him?” “As long as I live.” Fernand let fall his head '
                      'like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was like a '
                      'groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, '
                      'with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils, said,—“But '
                      'if he is dead——” “If he is dead, I shall die too.” “If '
                      'he has forgotten you——” “Mercédès!” called a joyous '
                      'voice from without,—“Mercédès!” “Ah,” exclaimed the '
                      'young girl, blushing with delight, and fairly leaping '
                      'in excess of love, “you see he has not forgotten me, '
                      'for here he is!” And rushing towards the door, she '
                      'opened it, saying, “Here, Edmond, here I am!” Fernand, '
                      'pale and trembling, drew back, like a traveller at the '
                      'sight of a serpent, and fell into a chair beside him. '
                      'Edmond and Mercédès were clasped in each other’s arms. '
                      'The burning Marseilles sun, which shot into the room '
                      'through the open door, covered them with a flood of '
                      'light. At first they saw nothing around them. Their '
                      'intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of '
                      'the world, and they only spoke in broken words, which '
                      'are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem '
                      'rather the expression of sorrow. Suddenly Edmond saw '
                      'the gloomy, pale, and threatening countenance of '
                      'Fernand, as it was defined in the shadow. By a movement '
                      'for which he could scarcely account to himself, the '
                      'young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt. '
                      '“Ah, your pardon,” said Dantès, frowning in his turn; '
                      '“I did not perceive that there were three of us.” Then, '
                      'turning to Mercédès, he inquired, “Who is this '
                      'gentleman?” “One who will be your best friend, Dantès, '

                      'look at her cousin. “An enemy in my house, do you say, '
                      'Edmond! If I believed that, I would place my arm under '
                      'yours and go with you to Marseilles, leaving the house '
                      'to return to it no more.” Fernand’s eye darted '
                      'lightning. “And should any misfortune occur to you, '
                      'dear Edmond,” she continued with the same calmness '
                      'which proved to Fernand that the young girl had read '
                      'the very innermost depths of his sinister thought, “if '
                      'misfortune should occur to you, I would ascend the '
                      'highest point of the Cape de Morgiou and cast myself '
                      'headlong from it.” Fernand became deadly pale. “But you '
                      'are deceived, Edmond,” she continued. “You have no '
                      'enemy here—there is no one but Fernand, my brother, who '
                      'will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.” And at these '
                      'words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the '
                      'Catalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly '
                      'towards Edmond, and offered him his hand. His hatred, '
                      'like a powerless though furious wave, was broken '
                      'against the strong ascendancy which Mercédès exercised '
                      'over him. Scarcely, however, had he touched Edmond’s '
                      'hand when he felt he had done all he could do, and '
                      'rushed hastily out of the house. “Oh,” he exclaimed, '
                      'running furiously and tearing his hair—“Oh, who will '
                      'deliver me from this man? Wretched—wretched that I am!” '
                      '“Hallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running '
                      'to?” exclaimed a voice. The young man stopped suddenly, '
                      'looked around him, and perceived Caderousse sitting at '
                      'table with Danglars, under an arbor. “Well”, said '
                      'Caderousse, “why don’t you come? Are you really in such '
                      'a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day '
                      'with your friends?” “Particularly when they have still '
                      'a full bottle before them,” added Danglars. Fernand '
                      'looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not '
                      'say a word. “He seems besotted,” said Danglars, pushing '
                      'Caderousse with his knee. “Are we mistaken, and is '
                      'Dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed?” '
                      '“Why, we must inquire into that,” was Caderousse’s '
                      'reply; and turning towards the young man, said, “Well, '
                      'Catalan, can’t you make up your mind?” Fernand wiped '
                      'away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and '
                      'slowly entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore '
                      'somewhat of calmness to his senses, and whose coolness '
                      'somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body. '
                      '“Good-day,” said he. “You called me, didn’t you?” And '
                      'he fell, rather than sat down, on one of the seats '
                      'which surrounded the table. “I called you because you '
                      'were running like a madman, and I was afraid you would '
                      'throw yourself into the sea,” said Caderousse, '
                      'laughing. “Why, when a man has friends, they are not '
                      'only to offer him a glass of wine, but, moreover, to '
                      'prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water '
                      'unnecessarily!” Fernand gave a groan, which resembled a '
                      'sob, and dropped his head into his hands, his elbows '
                      'leaning on the table. “Well, Fernand, I must say,” said '
                      'Caderousse, beginning the conversation, with that '
                      'brutality of the common people in which curiosity '
                      'destroys all diplomacy, “you look uncommonly like a '
                      'rejected lover;” and he burst into a hoarse laugh. '
                      '“Bah!” said Danglars, “a lad of his make was not born '
                      'to be unhappy in love. You are laughing at him, '
                      'Caderousse.” “No,” he replied, “only hark how he sighs! '
                      'Come, come, Fernand,” said Caderousse, “hold up your '
                      'head, and answer us. It’s not polite not to reply to '
                      'friends who ask news of your health.” “My health is '
                      'well enough,” said Fernand, clenching his hands without '
                      'raising his head. “Ah, you see, Danglars,” said '
                      'Caderousse, winking at his friend, “this is how it is; '
                      'Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave '
                      'Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and '
                      'he is in love with a very fine girl, named Mercédès; '
                      'but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine girl is in '
                      'love with the mate of the _Pharaon_; and as the '
                      '_Pharaon_ arrived today—why, you understand!” “No; I do '
                      'not understand,” said Danglars. “Poor Fernand has been '
                      'dismissed,” continued Caderousse. “Well, and what '
                      'then?” said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking '
                      'at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom '
                      'to vent his anger; “Mercédès is not accountable to any '
                      'person, is she? Is she not free to love whomsoever she '
                      'will?” “Oh, if you take it in that sense,” said '
                      'Caderousse, “it is another thing. But I thought you '
                      'were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans were not '
                      'men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It '
                      'was even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible '
                      'in his vengeance.” Fernand smiled piteously. “A lover '
                      'is never terrible,” he said. “Poor fellow!”'},

                      'conversation with Captain Leclere?” “No; we were quite '
                      'alone.” “Could your conversation have been overheard by '
                      'anyone?” “It might, for the cabin door was '
                      'open—and—stay; now I recollect,—Danglars himself passed '
                      'by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for '
                      'the grand marshal.” “That’s better,” cried the abbé; '
                      '“now we are on the right scent. Did you take anybody '
                      'with you when you put into the port of Elba?” “Nobody.” '
                      '“Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a '
                      'letter in place of it, I think?” “Yes; the grand '
                      'marshal did.” “And what did you do with that letter?” '
                      '“Put it into my portfolio.” “You had your portfolio '
                      'with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find room in '
                      'his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an '
                      'official letter?” “You are right; it was left on '
                      'board.” “Then it was not till your return to the ship '
                      'that you put the letter in the portfolio?” “No.” “And '
                      'what did you do with this same letter while returning '
                      'from Porto-Ferrajo to the vessel?” “I carried it in my '
                      'hand.” “So that when you went on board the _Pharaon_, '
                      'everybody could see that you held a letter in your '
                      'hand?” “Yes.” “Danglars, as well as the rest?” '
                      '“Danglars, as well as others.” “Now, listen to me, and '
                      'try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest. '
                      'Do you recollect the words in which the information '
                      'against you was formulated?” “Oh yes, I read it over '
                      'three times, and the words sank deeply into my memory.” '
                      '“Repeat it to me.” Dantès paused a moment, then said, '
                      '“This is it, word for word: ‘The king’s attorney is '
                      'informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that '
                      'one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the _Pharaon_, this '

                      'and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a '
                      'packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a '
                      'letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of '
                      'his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as '
                      'the letter will be found either about his person, at '
                      'his father’s residence, or in his cabin on board the '
                      '_Pharaon_.’” The abbé shrugged his shoulders. “The '
                      'thing is clear as day,” said he; “and you must have had '
                      'a very confiding nature, as well as a good heart, not '
                      'to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.” “Do '
                      'you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be '
                      'infamous.” “How did Danglars usually write?” “In a '
                      'handsome, running hand.” “And how was the anonymous '
                      'letter written?” “Backhanded.” Again the abbé smiled. '
                      '“Disguised.” “It was very boldly written, if '
                      'disguised.” “Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what '
                      'he called his pen, and, after dipping it into the ink, '
                      'he wrote on a piece of prepared linen, with his left '
                      'hand, the first two or three words of the accusation. '
                      'Dantès drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a '
                      'sensation almost amounting to terror. “How very '
                      'astonishing!” cried he at length. “Why your writing '
                      'exactly resembles that of the accusation.” “Simply '
                      'because that accusation had been written with the left '
                      'hand; and I have noticed that——” “What?” “That while '
                      'the writing of different persons done with the right '
                      'hand varies, that performed with the left hand is '
                      'invariably uniform.” “You have evidently seen and '
                      'observed everything.” “Let us proceed.” “Oh, yes, yes!” '
                      '“Now as regards the second question.” “I am listening.” '
                      '“Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent '
                      'your marriage with Mercédès?” “Yes; a young man who '
                      'loved her.” “And his name was——” “Fernand.” “That is a '
                      'Spanish name, I think?” “He was a Catalan.” “You '
                      'imagine him capable of writing the letter?” “Oh, no; he '
                      'would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a '
                      'knife into me.” “That is in strict accordance with the '
                      'Spanish character; an assassination they will '
                      'unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice, never.” '
                      '“Besides,” said Dantès, “the various circumstances '
                      'mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.” '
                      '“You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?” “To '

                      'Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of imprisonment '
                      'came from high authority, and the order for his '
                      'liberation must proceed from the same source; and, as '
                      'Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight, the '
                      'letters have not yet been forwarded.” “But,” said '
                      'Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these '
                      'formalities—of releasing him from arrest?” “There has '
                      'been no arrest.” “How?” “It is sometimes essential to '
                      'government to cause a man’s disappearance without '
                      'leaving any traces, so that no written forms or '
                      'documents may defeat their wishes.” “It might be so '
                      'under the Bourbons, but at present——” “It has always '
                      'been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV. '
                      'The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than '
                      'even Louis himself, and the number of prisoners whose '
                      'names are not on the register is incalculable.” Had '
                      'Morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness would have '
                      'dispelled them. “Well, M. de Villefort, how would you '
                      'advise me to act?” asked he. “Petition the minister.” '
                      '“Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two '
                      'hundred petitions every day, and does not read three.” '
                      '“That is true; but he will read a petition '
                      'countersigned and presented by me.” “And will you '
                      'undertake to deliver it?” “With the greatest pleasure. '
                      'Dantès was then guilty, and now he is innocent, and it '
                      'is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn '
                      'him.” Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an '
                      'inquiry, which, however improbable it might be, if it '
                      'did take place would leave him defenceless. “But how '
                      'shall I address the minister?” “Sit down there,” said '
                      'Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, “and write '
                      'what I dictate.” “Will you be so good?” “Certainly. But '
                      'lose no time; we have lost too much already.” “That is '
                      'true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be '
                      'suffering.” Villefort shuddered at the suggestion; but '
                      'he had gone too far to draw back. Dantès must be '
                      'crushed to gratify Villefort’s ambition. Villefort '
                      'dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent '
                      'intention, no doubt, Dantès’ patriotic services were '
                      'exaggerated, and he was made out one of the most active '
                      'agents of Napoleon’s return. It was evident that at the '
                      'sight of this document the minister would instantly '
                      'release him. The petition finished, Villefort read it '
                      'aloud. “That will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.” '
                      '“Will the petition go soon?” “Today.” “Countersigned by '
                      'you?” “The best thing I can do will be to certify the '
                      'truth of the contents of your petition.” And, sitting '
                      'down, Villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom. '
                      '“What more is to be done?” “I will do whatever is '
                      'necessary.” This assurance delighted Morrel, who took '
                      'leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old '
                      'Dantès that he would soon see his son. As for '
                      'Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully '
                      'preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised '
                      'Dantès, in the hopes of an event that seemed not '
                      'unlikely,—that is, a second restoration. Dantès '
                      'remained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the '
                      'fall of Louis XVIII.’s throne, or the still more tragic '
                      'destruction of the empire. Twice during the Hundred '
                      'Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice had '
                      'Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was '
                      'Waterloo, and Morrel came no more; he had done all that '
                      'was in his power, and any fresh attempt would only '
                      'compromise himself uselessly. Louis XVIII. remounted '
                      'the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had become '
                      'filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained '
                      'the situation of king’s procureur at Toulouse, and a '
                      'fortnight afterwards he married Mademoiselle de '
                      'Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher at court '
                      'than ever. And so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and '
                      'after Waterloo, remained in his dungeon, forgotten of '
                      'earth and heaven. Danglars comprehended the full extent '
                      'of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dantès; and, when '
                      'Napoleon returned to France, he, after the manner of '
                      'mediocre minds, termed the coincidence, _a decree of '
                      'Providence_. But when Napoleon returned to Paris, '
                      'Danglars’ heart failed him, and he lived in constant '
                      'fear of Dantès’ return on a mission of vengeance. He '
                      'therefore informed M. Morrel of his wish to quit the '
                      'sea, and obtained a recommendation from him to a '
                      'Spanish merchant, into whose service he entered at the '
                      'end of March, that is, ten or twelve days after '
                      'Napoleon’s return. He then left for Madrid, and was no '
                      'more heard of. Fernand understood nothing except that '
                      'Dantès was absent. What had become of him he cared not '
                      'to inquire. Only, during the respite the absence of his '
                      'rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means '
                      'of deceiving Mercédès as to the cause of his absence, '
                      'partly on plans of emigration and abduction, as from '
                      'time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of '
                      'Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence Marseilles and the '
                      'Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of a '
                      'young and handsome man, who was for him also the '
                      'messenger of vengeance. Fernand’s mind was made up; he '
                      'would shoot Dantès, and then kill himself. But Fernand '
                      'was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills '
                      'himself, for he constantly hopes. During this time the '
                      'empire made its last conscription, and every man in '
                      'France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the '
                      'summons of the emperor. Fernand departed with the rest, '
                      'bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was '
                      'away, his rival would perhaps return and marry '
                      'Mercédès. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he '
                      'would have done so when he parted from Mercédès. His '
                      'devotion, and the compassion he showed for her '
                      'misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce on '
                      'noble minds—Mercédès had always had a sincere regard '
                      'for Fernand, and this was now strengthened by '
                      'gratitude. “My brother,” said she, as she placed his '
                      'knapsack on his shoulders, “be careful of yourself, for '

                      'but to one’s self and the walls—walls have ears but no '
                      'tongue; but if a large fortune produces happiness, '
                      'Danglars is happy.” “And Fernand?” “Fernand? Why, much '
                      'the same story.” “But how could a poor Catalan '
                      'fisher-boy, without education or resources, make a '
                      'fortune? I confess this staggers me.” “And it has '
                      'staggered everybody. There must have been in his life '
                      'some strange secret that no one knows.” “But, then, by '
                      'what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or '
                      'high position?” “Both, sir—he has both fortune and '
                      'position—both.” “This must be impossible!” “It would '
                      'seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days '
                      'before the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. '
                      'The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans, '
                      'but Napoleon returned, a special levy was made, and '
                      'Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was '
                      'older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, '
                      'I was only sent to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in '
                      'the active army, went to the frontier with his '
                      'regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night '
                      'after that battle he was sentry at the door of a '
                      'general who carried on a secret correspondence with the '
                      'enemy. That same night the general was to go over to '
                      'the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him; '
                      'Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and '
                      'followed the general. “Fernand would have been '
                      'court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne, '
                      'but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He '
                      'returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, '
                      'and as the protection of the general, who is in the '
                      'highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a captain in '
                      '1823, during the Spanish war—that is to say, at the '
                      'time when Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand '
                      'was a Spaniard, and being sent to Spain to ascertain '
                      'the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found Danglars '
                      'there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over '
                      'the support of the royalists at the capital and in the '
                      'provinces, received promises and made pledges on his '
                      'own part, guided his regiment by paths known to himself '
                      'alone through the mountain gorges which were held by '
                      'the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in '
                      'this brief campaign that, after the taking of '
                      'Trocadero, he was made colonel, and received the title '
                      'of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of '
                      'Honor.” “Destiny! destiny!” murmured the abbé. “Yes, '
                      'but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being '
                      'ended, Fernand’s career was checked by the long peace '
                      'which seemed likely to endure throughout Europe. Greece '
                      'only had risen against Turkey, and had begun her war of '
                      'independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it '
                      'was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The '
                      'French government, without protecting them openly, as '
                      'you know, gave countenance to volunteer assistance. '
                      'Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in '
                      'Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll. '
                      '0345m Some time after, it was stated that the Comte de '
                      'Morcerf (this was the name he bore) had entered the '
                      'service of Ali Pasha with the rank of '
                      'instructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, '
                      'but before he died he recompensed the services of '
                      'Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which '
                      'he returned to France, when he was gazetted '
                      'lieutenant-general.” “So that now——?” inquired the '
                      'abbé. “So that now,” continued Caderousse, “he owns a '
                      'magnificent house—No. 27, Rue du Helder, Paris.” The '
                      'abbé opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, then, '
                      'making an effort at self-control, he said, “And '
                      'Mercédès—they tell me that she has disappeared?” '
                      '“Disappeared,” said Caderousse, “yes, as the sun '
                      'disappears, to rise the next day with still more '
                      'splendor.” “Has she made a fortune also?” inquired the '
                      'abbé, with an ironical smile. “Mercédès is at this '
                      'moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,” replied '
                      'Caderousse. “Go on,” said the abbé; “it seems as if I '
                      'were listening to the story of a dream. But I have seen '
                      'things so extraordinary, that what you tell me seems '
                      'less astonishing than it otherwise might.” “Mercédès '
                      'was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which '
                      'deprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts '

                      'elder Dantès. In the midst of her despair, a new '
                      'affliction overtook her. This was the departure of '
                      'Fernand—of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and '
                      'whom she regarded as her brother. Fernand went, and '

                      'Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair. “He is the '
                      'cause of all this misery—I am quite sure of it,” '
                      'whispered Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off '
                      'Fernand, to Danglars. “I don’t think so,” answered the '
                      'other; “he’s too stupid to imagine such a scheme. I '
                      'only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of '

                      'and abetted the deed,” said Caderousse. “Surely,” '
                      'answered Danglars, “one cannot be held responsible for '
                      'every chance arrow shot into the air.” “You can, '
                      'indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on '
                      'somebody’s head.” Meantime the subject of the arrest '
                      'was being canvassed in every different form. “What '
                      'think you, Danglars,” said one of the party, turning '
                      'towards him, “of this event?” “Why,” replied he, “I '
                      'think it just possible Dantès may have been detected '
                      'with some trifling article on board ship considered '
                      'here as contraband.” “But how could he have done so '
                      'without your knowledge, Danglars, since you are the '
                      'ship’s supercargo?” “Why, as for that, I could only '
                      'know what I was told respecting the merchandise with '
                      'which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with '
                      'cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria '
                      'from Pastret’s warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal’s; '
                      'that is all I was obliged to know, and I beg I may not '
                      'be asked for any further particulars.” “Now I '
                      'recollect,” said the afflicted old father; “my poor boy '
                      'told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, '
                      'and another of tobacco for me!” “There, you see,” '
                      'exclaimed Danglars. “Now the mischief is out; depend '
                      'upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about '
                      'the ship in our absence, and discovered poor Dantès’ '
                      'hidden treasures.” Mercédès, however, paid no heed to '
                      'this explanation of her lover’s arrest. Her grief, '
                      'which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst out '
                      'in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing. “Come, come,” '
                      'said the old man, “be comforted, my poor child; there '
                      'is still hope!” “Hope!” repeated Danglars. “Hope!” '
                      'faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die '
                      'away on his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm '
                      'passed over his countenance. “Good news! good news!” '
                      'shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony '
                      'on the lookout. “Here comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, '
                      'now, we shall hear that our friend is released!” '
                      'Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner '
                      'and greeted him at the door. He was very pale. “What '
                      'news?” exclaimed a general burst of voices. “Alas, my '
                      'friends,” replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of '
                      'his head, “the thing has assumed a more serious aspect '
                      'than I expected.” “Oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is '
                      'innocent!” sobbed forth Mercédès. “That I believe!” '
                      'answered M. Morrel; “but still he is charged——” “With '
                      'what?” inquired the elder Dantès. “With being an agent '
                      'of the Bonapartist faction!” Many of our readers may be '
                      'able to recollect how formidable such an accusation '
                      'became in the period at which our story is dated. A '
                      'despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès; the '
                      'old man sank into a chair. “Ah, Danglars!” whispered '
                      'Caderousse, “you have deceived me—the trick you spoke '
                      'of last night has been played; but I cannot suffer a '
                      'poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief '
                      'through your fault. I am determined to tell them all '
                      'about it.” “Be silent, you simpleton!” cried Danglars, '
                      'grasping him by the arm, “or I will not answer even for '
                      'your own safety. Who can tell whether Dantès be '
                      'innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba, where '
                      'he quitted it, and passed a whole day in the island. '
                      'Now, should any letters or other documents of a '
                      'compromising character be found upon him, will it not '
                      'be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his '
                      'accomplices?” With the rapid instinct of selfishness, '
                      'Caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode '
                      'of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on '
                      'Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity. '
                      '“Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,” '
                      'said he, casting a bewildered look on his companion. '
                      '“To be sure!” answered Danglars. “Let us wait, by all '
                      'means. If he be innocent, of course he will be set at '
                      'liberty; if guilty, why, it is no use involving '
                      'ourselves in a conspiracy.” “Let us go, then. I cannot '
                      'stay here any longer.” “With all my heart!” replied '
                      'Danglars, pleased to find the other so tractable. “Let '
                      'us take ourselves out of the way, and leave things for '
                      'the present to take their course.” After their '
                      'departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend '
                      'and protector of Mercédès, led the girl to her home, '
                      'while some friends of Dantès conducted his father, '
                      'nearly lifeless, to the Allées de Meilhan. The rumor of '
                      'Edmond’s arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in '
                      'circulating throughout the city. “Could you ever have '
                      'credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?” asked M. '
                      'Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose '
                      'of gleaning fresh tidings of Dantès, from M. de '
                      'Villefort, the assistant procureur, he overtook his '
                      'supercargo and Caderousse. “Could you have believed '
                      'such a thing possible?” “Why, you know I told you,” '
                      'replied Danglars, “that I considered the circumstance '
                      'of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very '
                      'suspicious circumstance.” “And did you mention these '
                      'suspicions to any person beside myself?” 0079m '
                      '“Certainly not!” returned Danglars. Then added in a low '
                      'whisper, “You understand that, on account of your '
                      'uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who served under the _other_ '
                      'government, and who does not altogether conceal what he '

                      'who had any feeling of ill-will towards me. I had '
                      'quarelled with him some time previously, and had even '
                      'challenged him to fight me; but he refused.” “Now we '
                      'are getting on. And what was this man’s name?” '
                      '“Danglars.” “What rank did he hold on board?” “He was '
                      'supercargo.” “And had you been captain, should you have '
                      'retained him in his employment?” “Not if the choice had '
                      'remained with me, for I had frequently observed '
                      'inaccuracies in his accounts.” “Good again! Now then, '
                      'tell me, was any person present during your last '
                      'conversation with Captain Leclere?” “No; we were quite '
                      'alone.” “Could your conversation have been overheard by '
                      'anyone?” “It might, for the cabin door was '
                      'open—and—stay; now I recollect,—Danglars himself passed '
                      'by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for '
                      'the grand marshal.” “That’s better,” cried the abbé; '
                      '“now we are on the right scent. Did you take anybody '
                      'with you when you put into the port of Elba?” “Nobody.” '
                      '“Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a '
                      'letter in place of it, I think?” “Yes; the grand '
                      'marshal did.” “And what did you do with that letter?” '
                      '“Put it into my portfolio.” “You had your portfolio '
                      'with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find room in '
                      'his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an '
                      'official letter?” “You are right; it was left on '
                      'board.” “Then it was not till your return to the ship '
                      'that you put the letter in the portfolio?” “No.” “And '
                      'what did you do with this same letter while returning '
                      'from Porto-Ferrajo to the vessel?” “I carried it in my '
                      'hand.” “So that when you went on board the _Pharaon_, '
                      'everybody could see that you held a letter in your '
                      'hand?” “Yes.” “Danglars, as well as the rest?” '
                      '“Danglars, as well as others.” “Now, listen to me, and '
                      'try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest. '
                      'Do you recollect the words in which the information '
                      'against you was formulated?” “Oh yes, I read it over '
                      'three times, and the words sank deeply into my memory.” '
                      '“Repeat it to me.” Dantès paused a moment, then said, '
                      '“This is it, word for word: ‘The king’s attorney is '
                      'informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that '
                      'one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the _Pharaon_, this '
                      'day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples '
                      'and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a '
                      'packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a '
                      'letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of '
                      'his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as '
                      'the letter will be found either about his person, at '
                      'his father’s residence, or in his cabin on board the '
                      '_Pharaon_.’” The abbé shrugged his shoulders. “The '
                      'thing is clear as day,” said he; “and you must have had '
                      'a very confiding nature, as well as a good heart, not '
                      'to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.” “Do '
                      'you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be '
                      'infamous.” “How did Danglars usually write?” “In a '
                      'handsome, running hand.” “And how was the anonymous '
                      'letter written?” “Backhanded.” Again the abbé smiled. '
                      '“Disguised.” “It was very boldly written, if '
                      'disguised.” “Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what '
                      'he called his pen, and, after dipping it into the ink, '
                      'he wrote on a piece of prepared linen, with his left '
                      'hand, the first two or three words of the accusation. '
                      'Dantès drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a '
                      'sensation almost amounting to terror. “How very '
                      'astonishing!” cried he at length. “Why your writing '
                      'exactly resembles that of the accusation.” “Simply '
                      'because that accusation had been written with the left '
                      'hand; and I have noticed that——” “What?” “That while '
                      'the writing of different persons done with the right '
                      'hand varies, that performed with the left hand is '
                      'invariably uniform.” “You have evidently seen and '
                      'observed everything.” “Let us proceed.” “Oh, yes, yes!” '
                      '“Now as regards the second question.” “I am listening.” '
                      '“Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent '
                      'your marriage with Mercédès?” “Yes; a young man who '
                      'loved her.” “And his name was——” “Fernand.” “That is a '
                      'Spanish name, I think?” “He was a Catalan.” “You '
                      'imagine him capable of writing the letter?” “Oh, no; he '
                      'would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a '
                      'knife into me.” “That is in strict accordance with the '
                      'Spanish character; an assassination they will '
                      'unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice, never.” '
                      '“Besides,” said Dantès, “the various circumstances '
                      'mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.” '
                      '“You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?” “To '

                      'Girondin and the daughter of an officer of the Duc de '

                      'conversation, interrupted us by saying, '
                      '‘Villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the '
                      'word Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed '
                      'considerable emphasis on that of Villefort—‘Villefort,’ '
                      'said his majesty, ‘is a young man of great judgment and '
                      'discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his '

                      'I should myself have recommended the match, had not the '
                      'noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my '

                      'condescended so far as to express himself so favorably '
                      'of me?” asked the enraptured Villefort. “I give you his '

                      'will confess that they perfectly agree with what his '
                      'majesty said to him, when he went six months ago to '
                      'consult him upon the subject of your espousing his '

                      'Now, then, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, '
                      'he would be most welcome.” “For my part, dear mother,” '
                      'interposed Renée, “I trust your wishes will not '
                      'prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty '

                      'into M. de Villefort’s hands,—then I shall be '
                      'contented.” “Just the same as though you prayed that a '
                      'physician might only be called upon to prescribe for '
                      'headaches, measles, and the stings of wasps, or any '
                      'other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to '
                      'see me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some '

                      'this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s '
                      'wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a '
                      'servant entered the room, and whispered a few words in '
                      'his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table and '
                      'quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he '
                      'soon, however, returned, his whole face beaming with '
                      'delight. Renée regarded him with fond affection; and '
                      'certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then '
                      'were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed '
                      'formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she '
                      'gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover. “You were '
                      'wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her, '
                      '“that I were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at '
                      'least resemble the disciples of Esculapius in one thing '

                      'now?” asked Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, with an air of '
                      'deep interest. “For a very serious matter, which bids '
                      'fair to make work for the executioner.” “How dreadful!” '
                      'exclaimed Renée, turning pale. “Is it possible?” burst '

                      'magistrate to hear his words. “Why, if my information '
                      'prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy has '
                      'just been discovered.” “Can I believe my ears?” cried '
                      'the marquise. “I will read you the letter containing '
                      'the accusation, at least,” said Villefort: “‘The king’s '

                      'letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in '
                      'Paris. Ample corroboration of this statement may be '
                      'obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond '
                      'Dantès, who either carries the letter for Paris about '
                      'with him, or has it at his father’s abode. Should it '
                      'not be found in the possession of father or son, then '
                      'it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging '
                      'to the said Dantès on board the _Pharaon_.’” “But,” '
                      'said Renée, “this letter, which, after all, is but an '
                      'anonymous scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to '

                      'his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own '
                      'bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he '
                      'was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of '
                      'another. “This philosophic reflection,” thought he, '
                      '“will make a great sensation at M. de Saint-Méran’s;” '
                      'and he arranged mentally, while Dantès awaited further '
                      'questions, the antithesis by which orators often create '
                      'a reputation for eloquence. When this speech was '
                      'arranged, Villefort turned to Dantès. 0099m “Go on, '
                      'sir,” said he. “What would you have me say?” “Give all '
                      'the information in your power.” “Tell me on which point '
                      'you desire information, and I will tell all I know; '
                      'only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very '
                      'little.” “Have you served under the usurper?” “I was '
                      'about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he '
                      'fell.” “It is reported your political opinions are '
                      'extreme,” said Villefort, who had never heard anything '
                      'of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as '
                      'if it were an accusation. “My political opinions!” '
                      'replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I never had any opinions. I '
                      'am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to '
                      'play. If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe '
                      'it to M. Morrel. Thus all my opinions—I will not say '
                      'public, but private—are confined to these three '
                      'sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and '
                      'I adore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and '
                      'you see how uninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, '
                      'Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance, '
                      'and recollected the words of Renée, who, without '
                      'knowing who the culprit was, had besought his '
                      'indulgence for him. With the deputy’s knowledge of '
                      'crime and criminals, every word the young man uttered '
                      'convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, '
                      'for he was scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent '
                      'with that eloquence of the heart never found when '
                      'sought for; full of affection for everybody, because he '
                      'was happy, and because happiness renders even the '
                      'wicked good—extended his affection even to his judge, '
                      'spite of Villefort’s severe look and stern accent. '
                      'Dantès seemed full of kindness. _“Pardieu!”_ said '
                      'Villefort, “he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain '
                      'Renée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she '
                      'ever imposed on me. I shall have at least a pressure of '
                      'the hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private.” Full '
                      'of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous, that '
                      'when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched '
                      'the change on his physiognomy, was smiling also. “Sir,” '
                      'said Villefort, “have you any enemies, at least, that '
                      'you know.” “I have enemies?” replied Dantès; “my '
                      'position is not sufficiently elevated for that. As for '
                      'my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat too hasty; '
                      'but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or '
                      'twelve sailors under me, and if you question them, they '
                      'will tell you that they love and respect me, not as a '
                      'father, for I am too young, but as an elder brother.” '
                      '“But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to '
                      'become captain at nineteen—an elevated post; you are '
                      'about to marry a pretty girl, who loves you; and these '
                      'two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of '
                      'someone.” “You are right; you know men better than I '
                      'do, and what you say may possibly be the case, I '
                      'confess; but if such persons are among my acquaintances '
                      'I prefer not to know it, because then I should be '
                      'forced to hate them.” “You are wrong; you should always '
                      'strive to see clearly around you. You seem a worthy '
                      'young man; I will depart from the strict line of my '
                      'duty to aid you in discovering the author of this '
                      'accusation. Here is the paper; do you know the '
                      'writing?” As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter from '
                      'his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. '
                      'A cloud passed over his brow as he said: “No, monsieur, '
                      'I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably '
                      'plain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very '
                      'fortunate,” added he, looking gratefully at Villefort, '
                      '“to be examined by such a man as you; for this envious '
                      'person is a real enemy.” And by the rapid glance that '
                      'the young man’s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much '
                      'energy lay hid beneath this mildness. “Now,” said the '
                      'deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a '
                      'judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest '
                      'in him, what truth is there in the accusation contained '
                      'in this anonymous letter?” And Villefort threw '
                      'disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantès had just '
                      'given back to him. “None at all. I will tell you the '
                      'real facts. I swear by my honor as a sailor, by my love '
                      'for Mercédès, by the life of my father——” “Speak, '
                      'monsieur,” said Villefort. Then, internally, “If Renée '
                      'could see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would '
                      'no longer call me a decapitator.” “Well, when we '
                      'quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a '
                      'brain fever. As we had'},

                      'him, approached; it was M. Morrel. “Ah, M. de '
                      'Villefort,” cried he, “I am delighted to see you. Some '
                      'of your people have committed the strangest '
                      'mistake—they have just arrested Edmond Dantès, mate of '
                      'my vessel.” “I know it, monsieur,” replied Villefort, '
                      '“and I am now going to examine him.” “Oh,” said Morrel, '
                      'carried away by his friendship, “you do not know him, '
                      'and I do. He is the most estimable, the most '
                      'trustworthy creature in the world, and I will venture '
                      'to say, there is not a better seaman in all the '
                      'merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your '
                      'indulgence for him.” Villefort, as we have seen, '
                      'belonged to the aristocratic party at Marseilles, '
                      'Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the '
                      'other suspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked '
                      'disdainfully at Morrel, and replied coldly: “You are '
                      'aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and '
                      'trustworthy in private life, and the best seaman in the '
                      'merchant service, and yet be, politically speaking, a '
                      'great criminal. Is it not true?” The magistrate laid '
                      'emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply them '
                      'to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge '
                      'into the heart of one who, interceding for another, had '
                      'himself need of indulgence. Morrel reddened, for his '
                      'own conscience was not quite clear on politics; '
                      'besides, what Dantès had told him of his interview with '
                      'the grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to '
                      'him, embarrassed him. He replied, however, in a tone of '
                      'deep interest: “I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as '
                      'you always are, kind and equitable, and give him back '
                      'to us soon.” This _give us_ sounded revolutionary in '
                      'the deputy’s ears. “Ah, ah,” murmured he, “is Dantès '
                      'then a member of some Carbonari society, that his '
                      'protector thus employs the collective form? He was, if '
                      'I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a '
                      'great many others.” Then he added, “Monsieur, you may '
                      'rest assured I shall perform my duty impartially, and '
                      'that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to '
                      'me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this '
                      'present epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous '
                      'example, and I must do my duty.” 0097m As he had now '
                      'arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined '
                      'the Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly '
                      'saluted the shipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on '
                      'the spot where Villefort had left him. The antechamber '
                      'was full of police agents and gendarmes, in the midst '
                      'of whom, carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood '
                      'the prisoner. Villefort traversed the antechamber, cast '
                      'a side glance at Dantès, and taking a packet which a '
                      'gendarme offered him, disappeared, saying, “Bring in '
                      'the prisoner.” Rapid as had been Villefort’s glance, it '
                      'had served to give him an idea of the man he was about '
                      'to interrogate. He had recognized intelligence in the '
                      'high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, '
                      'and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of '
                      'pearly teeth. Villefort’s first impression was '
                      'favorable; but he had been so often warned to mistrust '
                      'first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the '
                      'impression, forgetting the difference between the two '
                      'words. He stifled, therefore, the feelings of '
                      'compassion that were rising, composed his features, and '
                      'sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An instant '
                      'after Dantès entered. He was pale, but calm and '
                      'collected, and saluting his judge with easy politeness, '
                      'looked round for a seat, as if he had been in M. '
                      'Morrel’s salon. It was then that he encountered for the '
                      'first time Villefort’s look,—that look peculiar to the '
                      'magistrate, who, while seeming to read the thoughts of '
                      'others, betrays nothing of his own. “Who and what are '
                      'you?” demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of '
                      'papers, containing information relative to the '
                      'prisoner, that a police agent had given to him on his '
                      'entry, and that, already, in an hour’s time, had '
                      'swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the '
                      'corrupt espionage of which “the accused” is always made '
                      'the victim. “My name is Edmond Dantès,” replied the '
                      'young man calmly; “I am mate of the _Pharaon_, '
                      'belonging to Messrs. Morrel & Son.” “Your age?” '
                      'continued Villefort. “Nineteen,” returned Dantès. “What '
                      'were you doing at the moment you were arrested?” “I was '
                      'at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,” said the '
                      'young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was '
                      'the contrast between that happy moment and the painful '
                      'ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the '
                      'contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort '
                      'and the radiant face of Mercédès. “You were at the '
                      'festival of your marriage?” said the deputy, shuddering '
                      'in spite of himself. “Yes, monsieur; I am on the point '
                      'of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for '
                      'three years.” Villefort, impassive as he was, was '
                      'struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice '
                      'of Dantès, surprised in the midst of his happiness, '
                      'struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom—he also was '
                      'on the point of being married, and he was summoned from '
                      'his own happiness to destroy that of another. “This '
                      'philosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great '
                      'sensation at M. de Saint-Méran’s;” and he arranged '
                      'mentally, while Dantès awaited further questions, the '

                      'reached Dantès’ eyes through the coarse sack that '
                      'covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed, a '
                      'third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand. '
                      'The two men, approaching the ends of the bed, took the '
                      'sack by its extremities. “He’s heavy, though, for an '
                      'old and thin man,” said one, as he raised the head. '
                      '“They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of '
                      'the bones,” said another, lifting the feet. “Have you '
                      'tied the knot?” inquired the first speaker. “What would '
                      'be the use of carrying so much more weight?” was the '
                      'reply, “I can do that when we get there.” “Yes, you’re '
                      'right,” replied the companion. “What’s the knot for?” '
                      'thought Dantès. They deposited the supposed corpse on '
                      'the bier. Edmond stiffened himself in order to play the '
                      'part of a dead man, and then the party, lighted by the '
                      'man with the torch, who went first, ascended the '
                      'stairs. Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air, '
                      'and Dantès knew that the mistral was blowing. It was a '
                      'sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely '
                      'mingled. The bearers went on for twenty paces, then '
                      'stopped, putting the bier down on the ground. One of '
                      'them went away, and Dantès heard his shoes striking on '
                      'the pavement. “Where am I?” he asked himself. “Really, '
                      'he is by no means a light load!” said the other bearer, '
                      'sitting on the edge of the hand-barrow. Dantès’ first '
                      'impulse was to escape, but fortunately he did not '
                      'attempt it. “Give us a light,” said the other bearer, '
                      '“or I shall never find what I am looking for.” The man '
                      'with the torch complied, although not asked in the most '
                      'polite terms. “What can he be looking for?” thought '
                      'Edmond. “The spade, perhaps.” An exclamation of '
                      'satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had found '
                      'the object of his search. “Here it is at last,” he '
                      'said, “not without some trouble, though.” “Yes,” was '
                      'the answer, “but it has lost nothing by waiting.” As he '
                      'said this, the man came towards Edmond, who heard a '
                      'heavy metallic substance laid down beside him, and at '
                      'the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with '
                      'sudden and painful violence. “Well, have you tied the '
                      'knot?” inquired the grave-digger, who was looking on. '
                      '“Yes, and pretty tight too, I can tell you,” was the '
                      'answer. “Move on, then.” And the bier was lifted once '
                      'more, and they proceeded. They advanced fifty paces '
                      'farther, and then stopped to open a door, then went '
                      'forward again. The noise of the waves dashing against '
                      'the rocks on which the château is built, reached '
                      'Dantès’ ear distinctly as they went forward. “Bad '
                      'weather!” observed one of the bearers; “not a pleasant '
                      'night for a dip in the sea.” “Why, yes, the abbé runs a '
                      'chance of being wet,” said the other; and then there '
                      'was a burst of brutal laughter. Dantès did not '
                      'comprehend the jest, but his hair stood erect on his '
                      'head. “Well, here we are at last,” said one of them. “A '
                      'little farther—a little farther,” said the other. “You '
                      'know very well that the last was stopped on his way, '
                      'dashed on the rocks, and the governor told us next day '
                      'that we were careless fellows.” They ascended five or '
                      'six more steps, and then Dantès felt that they took '
                      'him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and '
                      'swung him to and fro. “One!” said the grave-diggers, '
                      '“two! three!” And at the same instant Dantès felt '
                      'himself flung into the air like a wounded bird, '
                      'falling, falling, with a rapidity that made his blood '
                      'curdle. Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight '
                      'which hastened his rapid descent, it seemed to him as '
                      'if the fall lasted for a century. At last, with a '
                      'horrible splash, he darted like an arrow into the '
                      'ice-cold water, and as he did so he uttered a shrill '
                      'cry, stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the '
                      'waves. Dantès had been flung into the sea, and was '
                      'dragged into its depths by a thirty-six-pound shot tied '
                      'to his feet. The sea is the cemetery of the Château '
                      'd’If. 0267m Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen Dantès, '
                      'although stunned and almost suffocated, had sufficient '
                      'presence of mind to hold his breath, and as his right '
                      'hand (prepared as he was for every chance) held his '
                      'knife open, he rapidly ripped up the sack, extricated '
                      'his arm, and then his body; but in spite of all his '
                      'efforts to free himself from the shot, he felt it '
                      'dragging him down still lower. He then bent his body, '
                      'and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound '
                      'his legs, at the moment when it seemed as if he were '
                      'actually strangled. With a mighty leap he rose to the '
                      'surface of the sea, while the shot dragged down to the '
                      'depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud. '
                      'Dantès waited only to get breath, and then dived, in '
                      'order to avoid being seen. When he arose a second time, '
                      'he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk. He saw '
                      'overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across which the '
                      'wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a '
                      'twinkling star to appear; before him was the vast '

                      'are you taking me?” asked he. “You will soon know.” '
                      '“But still——” “We are forbidden to give you any '
                      'explanation.” Dantès, trained in discipline, knew that '
                      'nothing would be more absurd than to question '
                      'subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he '
                      'remained silent. The most vague and wild thoughts '
                      'passed through his mind. The boat they were in could '
                      'not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor '
                      'outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were '
                      'going to leave him on some distant point. He was not '
                      'bound, nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him; '
                      'this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy, '
                      'who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he '
                      'did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had '
                      'nothing to apprehend? Had not Villefort in his presence '
                      'destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof against him? '
                      'He waited silently, striving to pierce through the '
                      'darkness. They had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the '
                      'lighthouse stood, on the right, and were now opposite '
                      'the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the prisoner that '
                      'he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for '
                      'it was there Mercédès dwelt. How was it that a '
                      'presentiment did not warn Mercédès that her lover was '
                      'within three hundred yards of her? One light alone was '
                      'visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’ '
                      'chamber. Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole '
                      'settlement. A loud cry could be heard by her. But pride '
                      'restrained him and he did not utter it. What would his '
                      'guards think if they heard him shout like a madman? He '
                      'remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the '
                      'boat went on, but the prisoner thought only of '
                      'Mercédès. An intervening elevation of land hid the '
                      'light. Dantès turned and perceived that they had got '
                      'out to sea. While he had been absorbed in thought, they '
                      'had shipped their oars and hoisted sail; the boat was '
                      'now moving with the wind. In spite of his repugnance to '
                      'address the guards, Dantès turned to the nearest '
                      'gendarme, and taking his hand, “Comrade,” said he, “I '
                      'adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to tell me '
                      'where we are going. I am Captain Dantès, a loyal '
                      'Frenchman, thought accused of treason; tell me where '
                      'you are conducting me, and I promise you on my honor I '
                      'will submit to my fate.” The gendarme looked '
                      'irresolutely at his companion, who returned for answer '
                      'a sign that said, “I see no great harm in telling him '
                      'now,” and the gendarme replied: “You are a native of '
                      'Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know where '
                      'you are going?” “On my honor, I have no idea.” “Have '
                      'you no idea whatever?” “None at all.” “That is '
                      'impossible.” “I swear to you it is true. Tell me, I '
                      'entreat.” “But my orders.” “Your orders do not forbid '
                      'your telling me what I must know in ten minutes, in '
                      'half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even '
                      'if I intended.” “Unless you are blind, or have never '
                      'been outside the harbor, you must know.” “I do not.” '
                      '“Look round you then.” Dantès rose and looked forward, '
                      'when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the '
                      'black and frowning rock on which stands the Château '
                      'd’If. This gloomy fortress, which has for more than '
                      'three hundred years furnished food for so many wild '
                      'legends, seemed to Dantès like a scaffold to a '
                      'malefactor. “The Château d’If?” cried he, “what are we '
                      'going there for?” The gendarme smiled. “I am not going '
                      'there to be imprisoned,” said Dantès; “it is only used '
                      'for political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are '
                      'there any magistrates or judges at the Château d’If?” '
                      '“There are only,” said the gendarme, “a governor, a '
                      'garrison, turnkeys, and good thick walls. Come, come, '
                      'do not look so astonished, or you will make me think '
                      'you are laughing at me in return for my good nature.” '
                      'Dantès pressed the gendarme’s hand as though he would '
                      'crush it. “You think, then,” said he, “that I am taken '
                      'to the Château d’If to be imprisoned there?” “It is '
                      'probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.” '
                      '“Without any inquiry, without any formality?” “All the '
                      'formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is '
                      'already made.” “And so, in spite of M. de Villefort’s '
                      'promises?” “I do not know what M. de Villefort promised '
                      'you,” said the gendarme, “but I know we are taking you '
                      'to the Château d’If. But what are you doing? Help, '
                      'comrades, help!” By a rapid movement, which the '
                      'gendarme’s practiced eye had perceived, Dantès sprang '
                      'forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but four '
                      'vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom '
                      'of the boat. He fell back cursing with rage. “Good!” '
                      'said the gendarme, placing his knee on his chest; “this '
                      'is the way you keep your word as a sailor! Believe '
                      'soft-spoken gentlemen again! Hark ye, my friend, I have '
                      'disobeyed my first order, but I will not disobey the '
                      'second; and if you move, I will blow your brains out.” '
                      'And he levelled his carbine at Dantès, who felt the '
                      'muzzle against his temple. For a moment the idea of '
                      'struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending the '
                      'unexpected evil that had overtaken him. But he '
                      'bethought him of M. de Villefort’s promise; and, '
                      'besides, death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme '
                      'seemed too terrible. He remained motionless, but '
                      'gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury. At '
                      'this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent '
                      'shock. One of the sailors leaped on shore, a cord '
                      'creaked as it ran through a pulley, and Dantès guessed '
                      'they were at the end of the voyage, and that they were '

                      'fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to '
                      'Marseilles! What can I do? What story can I invent? '
                      'under pretext of trading along the coast, these men, '
                      'who are in reality smugglers, will prefer selling me to '
                      'doing a good action. I must wait. But I cannot—I am '
                      'starving. In a few hours my strength will be utterly '
                      'exhausted; besides, perhaps I have not been missed at '
                      'the fortress. I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked '
                      'last night. My story will be accepted, for there is no '
                      'one left to contradict me.” As he spoke, Dantès looked '
                      'toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had been '
                      'wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors '
                      'hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had '
                      'formed part of the vessel’s keel, floated at the foot '
                      'of the crag. In an instant Dantès’ plan was formed. He '
                      'swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of '
                      'the timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the '
                      'course the vessel was taking. “I am saved!” murmured '
                      'he. And this conviction restored his strength. He soon '
                      'saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was '
                      'tacking between the Château d’If and the tower of '
                      'Planier. For an instant he feared lest, instead of '
                      'keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea; but he '
                      'soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound '
                      'for Italy, between the islands of Jaros and '
                      'Calaseraigne. However, the vessel and the swimmer '
                      'insensibly neared one another, and in one of its tacks '
                      'the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him. '
                      'He rose on the waves, making signs of distress; but no '
                      'one on board saw him, and the vessel stood on another '
                      'tack. Dantès would have shouted, but he knew that the '
                      'wind would drown his voice. It was then he rejoiced at '
                      'his precaution in taking the timber, for without it he '
                      'would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the '
                      'vessel—certainly to return to shore, should he be '
                      'unsuccessful in attracting attention. Dantès, though '
                      'almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, '
                      'had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood '
                      'towards him. Then he advanced; but before they could '
                      'meet, the vessel again changed her course. By a violent '
                      'effort he rose half out of the water, waving his cap, '
                      'and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors. This '
                      'time he was both seen and heard, and the tartan '
                      'instantly steered towards him. At the same time, he saw '
                      'they were about to lower the boat. An instant after, '
                      'the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards '
                      'him. Dantès let go of the timber, which he now thought '
                      'to be useless, and swam vigorously to meet them. But he '
                      'had reckoned too much upon his strength, and then he '
                      'realized how serviceable the timber had been to him. '
                      'His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, '
                      'and he was almost breathless. He shouted again. The two '
                      'sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of them cried '
                      'in Italian, “Courage!” The word reached his ear as a '
                      'wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount '
                      'passed over his head. He rose again to the surface, '
                      'struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning '
                      'man, uttered a third cry, and felt himself sinking, as '
                      'if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet. '
                      'The water passed over his head, and the sky turned '
                      'gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the '
                      'surface. He felt himself seized by the hair, then he '
                      'saw and heard nothing. He had fainted. When he opened '
                      'his eyes Dantès found himself on the deck of the '
                      'tartan. His first care was to see what course they were '
                      'taking. They were rapidly leaving the Château d’If '
                      'behind. Dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of '
                      'joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh. As we have '
                      'said, he was lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing '
                      'his limbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he '
                      'recognized as the one who had cried out “Courage!” held '
                      'a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while the third, an '
                      'old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on '
                      'with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune '
                      'that they have escaped yesterday, and which may '
                      'overtake them tomorrow. A few drops of the rum restored '
                      'suspended animation, while the friction of his limbs '
                      'restored their elasticity. “Who are you?” said the '
                      'pilot in bad French. “I am,” replied Dantès, in bad '
                      'Italian, “a Maltese sailor. We were coming from '
                      'Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night '
                      'overtook us at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on '
                      'these rocks.” “Where do you come from?” “From these '
                      'rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our '

                      'God!” he muttered, “whence comes this thought? Is it '

                      'Without giving himself time to reconsider his decision, '

                      'distracted from his desperate resolution, he bent over '
                      'the appalling shroud, opened it with the knife which '
                      'Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore '
                      'it along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his '

                      'around his own, covered it with his counterpane, once '
                      'again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried vainly to '
                      'close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned '
                      'the head towards the wall, so that the jailer might, '
                      'when he brought the evening meal, believe that he was '
                      'asleep, as was his frequent custom; entered the tunnel '
                      'again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to the '
                      'other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and '
                      'thread, flung off his rags, that they might feel only '
                      'naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas, and getting '
                      'inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in which '
                      'the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of '
                      'the sack from the inside. He would have been discovered '
                      'by the beating of his heart, if by any mischance the '
                      'jailers had entered at that moment. Dantès might have '
                      'waited until the evening visit was over, but he was '
                      'afraid that the governor would change his mind, and '
                      'order the dead body to be removed earlier. In that case '
                      'his last hope would have been destroyed. Now his plans '
                      'were fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If '
                      'while he was being carried out the grave-diggers should '
                      'discover that they were bearing a live instead of a '
                      'dead body, Dantès did not intend to give them time to '
                      'recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife, he '
                      'meant to open the sack from top to bottom, and, '
                      'profiting by their alarm, escape; if they tried to '
                      'catch him, he would use his knife to better purpose. '
                      '0263m If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in '
                      'a grave, he would allow himself to be covered with '
                      'earth, and then, as it was night, the grave-diggers '
                      'could scarcely have turned their backs before he would '
                      'have worked his way through the yielding soil and '
                      'escaped. He hoped that the weight of earth would not be '
                      'so great that he could not overcome it. If he was '
                      'detected in this and the earth proved too heavy, he '
                      'would be stifled, and then—so much the better, all '
                      'would be over. Dantès had not eaten since the preceding '
                      'evening, but he had not thought of hunger, nor did he '
                      'think of it now. His situation was too precarious to '
                      'allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one. '
                      'The first risk that Dantès ran was, that the jailer, '
                      'when he brought him his supper at seven o’clock, might '
                      'perceive the change that had been made; fortunately, '
                      'twenty times at least, from misanthropy or fatigue, '
                      'Dantès had received his jailer in bed, and then the man '
                      'placed his bread and soup on the table, and went away '
                      'without saying a word. This time the jailer might not '
                      'be as silent as usual, but speak to Dantès, and seeing '
                      'that he received no reply, go to the bed, and thus '
                      'discover all. When seven o’clock came, Dantès’ agony '
                      'really began. His hand placed upon his heart was unable '
                      'to redress its throbbings, while, with the other he '
                      'wiped the perspiration from his temples. From time to '
                      'time chills ran through his whole body, and clutched '
                      'his heart in a grasp of ice. Then he thought he was '
                      'going to die. Yet the hours passed on without any '
                      'unusual disturbance, and Dantès knew that he had '
                      'escaped the first peril. It was a good augury. At '
                      'length, about the hour the governor had appointed, '
                      'footsteps were heard on the stairs. Edmond felt that '
                      'the moment had arrived, summoned up all his courage, '
                      'held his breath, and would have been happy if at the '
                      'same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his '
                      'veins. The footsteps—they were double—paused at the '
                      'door—and Dantès guessed that the two grave-diggers had '
                      'come to seek him—this idea was soon converted into '
                      'certainty, when he heard the noise they made in putting '
                      'down the hand-bier. The door opened, and a dim light '
                      'reached Dantès’ eyes through the coarse sack that '
                      'covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed, a '
                      'third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand. '
                      'The two men, approaching the ends of the bed, took the '
                      'sack by its extremities. “He’s heavy, though, for an '

                      'another trial; he was to find out whether he could '
                      'recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for '
                      'fourteen years. He had preserved a tolerably good '

                      'find out what the man had become. His comrades believed '

                      'hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man '
                      'with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which '
                      'gave his head the appearance of one of Titian’s '
                      'portraits. At this period it was not the fashion to '
                      'wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber '
                      'would only be surprised if a man gifted with such '
                      'advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive '
                      'himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and '
                      'went to work. When the operation was concluded, and '
                      'Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and '
                      'his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a '
                      'looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, '
                      'three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years’ '
                      'imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his '
                      'appearance. Dantès had entered the Château d’If with '
                      'the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, '
                      'with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and '
                      'who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. '
                      'This was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, '
                      'his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines '
                      'which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched '
                      'beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were '
                      'full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally '
                      'sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his '
                      'complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that '
                      'pale color which produces, when the features are '
                      'encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of '
                      'the man of the north; the profound learning he had '
                      'acquired had besides diffused over his features a '
                      'refined intellectual expression; and he had also '
                      'acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that '
                      'vigor which a frame possesses which has so long '
                      'concentrated all its force within itself. 0283m To the '
                      'elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the '
                      'solidity of a rounded and muscular figure. As to his '
                      'voice, prayers, sobs, and imprecations had changed it '
                      'so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating '
                      'sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse. '
                      'Moreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, '
                      'his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing '
                      'objects in the night, common to the hyena and the wolf. '
                      'Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible '
                      'that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend '
                      'left—could recognize him; he could not recognize '
                      'himself. The master of _La Jeune Amélie_, who was very '
                      'desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of '
                      'Edmond’s value, had offered to advance him funds out of '
                      'his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next '
                      'care on leaving the barber’s who had achieved his first '
                      'metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete '
                      'sailor’s suit—a garb, as we all know, very simple, and '
                      'consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt, and a '
                      'cap. It was in this costume, and bringing back to '
                      'Jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him, that '
                      'Edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger, who '
                      'had made him tell his story over and over again before '
                      'he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim '
                      'sailor the man with thick and matted beard, hair '
                      'tangled with seaweed, and body soaking in seabrine, '
                      'whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned. '
                      'Attracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed '
                      'his offers of an engagement to Dantès; but Dantès, who '
                      'had his own projects, would not agree for a longer time '
                      'than three months. _La Jeune Amélie_ had a very active '
                      'crew, very obedient to their captain, who lost as '
                      'little time as possible. He had scarcely been a week at '
                      'Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with '
                      'printed muslins, contraband cottons, English powder, '
                      'and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put '
                      'its mark. The master was to get all this out of Leghorn '
                      'free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, '
                      'where certain speculators undertook to forward the '
                      'cargo to France. They sailed; Edmond was again cleaving '
                      'the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his '
                      'youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in prison. '
                      'He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his '
                      'left, and went towards the country of Paoli and '
                      'Napoleon. The next morning going on deck, as he always '
                      'did at an early hour, the patron found Dantès leaning '
